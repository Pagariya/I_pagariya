Welcome to Anshul's Repository:


In these repositories I put all the pratice I did related to **Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer vision, Reinforcement learning and Robotics** related topics. This repository reflects my hands on expereince with:


1. **Robotics** - ROS 1 package for Agriculture robot simulation.

3. **Robotics**- Python driver control of UR robots, Robot kinematics scripts, GUI creation to set points for robot for pick and place application, Pybullet, Gazebo and ROS

4. **Machine learning and Computer Vision** - Deep learning, Classification algorithms, Feature selection and Feature importance algorithms

5. **Data Science** - Time series feature calculation, Data visualization, Feature selection and Feature importance algorithms

6. **Reinforcement learning** - Custom agent creation, RLLIB, Stable baseline, RL algorithm application for Robotic control
