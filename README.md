In these repositories I put all the pratice I did related to **Machine Learning, Computer vision, Reinforcment learning and Robotics** related topics. This repositorx reflects my hands on expereince with:


1. **Robotics**- UR5, Python driver control, GUI creation to set points for robot for pick and place application, Pybullet, Gazebo and ROS


3. **Machine learning** - Deep learning, Classification algorithms, Feature selection and Feature importance algorithms


5. **Reinforcement learning** - Custom agent creation, RLLIB, Stable baseline, RL algorithm application for Robotic control
